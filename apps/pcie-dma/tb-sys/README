Fullchip simulation of the register-readback example.

The altpcietb_bfm_driver_chaining.v testbench is modified from the Altera-generated file, and
implements the behaviour of the CPU side. Similarly the pcie_tb.vhdl file is also based on the
Altera-generated file, and implements the FPGA-side behaviour. Since this application is
self-contained (i.e no external connections that must be mocked), it is pretty minimal.
