Minimal Altera PCI Express project, including Linux driver & userspace examples, the requisite
Altera PCIe core and supporting logic, and a simple DMA controller. The Linux driver is licensed
under the GPLv3, and everything else is under the MIT license.

Note that to do any simulation, you'll need to set the PROJ_HOME environment variable to the
absolute path of the directory in which this README resides.

ip:
  Various IP blocks, both custom and from Altera (wrapped), with unit-tests.

apps:
  A couple of synthesizable (and system-simulatable) application designs, with "example" subdirs
  including userspace application code.

driver:
  A minimal Linux device-driver, based on altpciechdma.c.
